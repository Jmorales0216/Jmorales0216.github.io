# 499 Final Project – ePortfolio

# Jesse Morales

This repository contains my final project for CS 499. It represents my professional ePortfolio and shows my growth throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. The portfolio includes original and enhanced artifacts, written narratives, and a code review video. Together, these materials demonstrate my skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

My ePortfolio is designed to be easy to navigate and clearly organized so reviewers and future employers can quickly understand my work and progress.

ePortfolio Website

You can view my live ePortfolio here:

The website includes my professional self assessment, a link to my code review video, and access to all required artifacts and narratives.

Code Review Video

My code review video explains the original functionality of my selected artifacts, identifies areas for improvement, and discusses the enhancements made during CS 499.

Artifacts Included
Software Design and Engineering

CS320_Original.zip

CS320_Enhanced.zip

This artifact demonstrates object oriented design, validation logic, service layer structure, and unit testing. The enhanced version improves code structure, readability, and maintainability.

Algorithms and Data Structures

CS300 Course Planner project
This artifact demonstrates the use of data structures, sorting logic, and efficient searching. Enhancements focus on cleaner logic and better organization.

Databases

CS 465 original Travlr project

CS 465 enhanced Travlr project

This artifact demonstrates full stack development using a database driven application. The enhanced version improves structure, organization, and data handling to better reflect real world database usage.

Narratives

Written narratives are included for each enhancement. These explain why each artifact was selected, how it was improved, what skills were demonstrated, and what was learned during the enhancement process.

Purpose of This Portfolio

This ePortfolio was created to:

Demonstrate my technical skills with real projects

Show my ability to improve and refactor existing code

Reflect on my growth as a computer science student

Provide a professional portfolio that can be shared with employers
